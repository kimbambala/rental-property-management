This application allows potential renters to view available rental properties. Existing renters can see when their rent is due. Landlords can list properties, see when rent is due (or overdue).  Optionally, renters can submit maintenance requests, landlords can assign maintenance requests and service staff can view the requests assigned to them and indicate when they have been completed.
